Reorganized code. Wrote a simple script to read a file in binary mode, deconstruct each byte read down into bits, and play a tone for each bit (different tone for bit 0 and bit 1)

Completed a simple program that generates two different tone.
Note:
  - Mono ouput because even if a computer has more than one channel, no reason to output differently for each

Programming Decision
	Using C++
	Selected RtAudio library for audio input/output


How RtAudio and other sound libraries work.
	- Each OS has one or more native sound api in addition to others that are non-standard or deprecated. The audio library encapsulate the way that each native API works in order for developer to write audio software.
